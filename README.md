Here is a small game that I made in a really fun week-long development period. Download the appropriate version for either Windows or Mac and check it out!

Do note that, according to the project specifications, the 1 2 and 3 keys get you to different areas of the game, C gets you to the end screen, shift is to attack, space is to jump, arrows move, and M gets you to the menu on which you use the mouse.

Mac download guide: Upon opening the game, you may get the error that thee file is damaged and cannot be opened. You can easily bypass this by running,

xattr -cr /pathto/Tethys.app

Windows should be more straightforward.

This was made in GameMaker Studio.
